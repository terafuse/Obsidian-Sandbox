I think the way I use this folder is similar to this method.
I intend to be able to just drop notes and thoughts into this folder with the correct tags and links to be able to browse back to these notes when relevant.

But.. I also intend to use the info in this area to elaborate on or organize the info in a way that it fits into the Notebooks folder. The Notebooks folder is intended to be an organized collection.
