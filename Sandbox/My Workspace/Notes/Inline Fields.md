Besides what [@atiz](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/atiz) said, I just add this:

1. Full-line inline fields - Fields alone in full line. This is the best option if you want a more complex as a text. For example:

# This is the book title
summary:: This is my summary or abstract. With an full inline field I can write a small or long paragraph. The field content stops when I break/change the line.

Now the content of my note…

2. Inline Fields - fields inserted anywhere (for example inside the text or a task). This is the best solution for short `key:: value` (similar to tags) and can be used with two different syntaxes (the differences between the two resides in the way they are rendered in preview mode - need to try to see the differences in parallel with the new dataview setting “Enable Inline Field Highlighting”): [key:: value] or (Key:: value)  

Example:
# This is the book title
